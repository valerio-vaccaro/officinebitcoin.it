# HAN SOLOminer and Nerdminer

## Introduction
HAN SOLOminer is a "game" capable of explaining to Satoshi Spritz what mining is and how it happens by connecting to a pool with stratum; from this first prototype, nerdminer was derived.

Bitcoin's difficulty is such that Nerdminers will never mine a block (and neither will a million nerdminers).
