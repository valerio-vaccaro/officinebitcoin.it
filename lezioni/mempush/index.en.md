# MemPush: Send and manage Bitcoin transactions in the mempool with simplicity

MemPush (https://mempush.com/) is an innovative platform that makes sending and managing Bitcoin transactions in the mempool simple, secure, and accessible. The mempool, the temporary "reservoir" of Bitcoin transactions waiting for confirmation on the blockchain, is the heart of this service, which eliminates technical complexities for users and developers.

## What is MemPush?

MemPush is a web service that allows you to send raw Bitcoin transactions (in hexadecimal format) directly to the mempool, without the need for advanced configurations or personal Bitcoin nodes. Designed by Valerio Vaccaro, MemPush also supports the Tor network to ensure greater privacy for users.

The source code, available on GitHub (https://github.com/valerio-vaccaro/mempush) under an open-source license, allows anyone to verify the project's security, contribute to its development, or host a personalized instance of the service.

## How does MemPush work?

The MemPush interface is intuitive and user-friendly:

1. **Access the site**: Visit https://mempush.com/.
2. **Enter the raw transaction**: Paste the Bitcoin transaction in hexadecimal format in the dedicated field.
3. **Send the transaction**: Click "Submit Raw Transaction" to propagate the transaction to the mempool through Bitcoin nodes.
4. **Monitor the status**: Check the transaction progress with a blockchain explorer.
5. **Automatic retransmission**: MemPush automatically retransmits transactions, if necessary, to ensure their permanence in the mempool.

No registration is required, and the open-source approach eliminates hidden risks, making MemPush ideal even for less experienced users.

## Who is MemPush for?

MemPush is designed to meet various needs:
1. **Low fees**: Transactions with low fees are automatically retransmitted to prevent them from being removed from the mempool during traffic spikes.
2. **Timelocked transactions**: Supports monitoring and retransmission of transactions with time constraints, ensuring their effective management.
3. **Advanced monitoring**: MemPush periodically checks transaction status, allowing removal only of confirmed or invalidated transactions (e.g., double-spends).
4. **Enhanced privacy**: Thanks to Tor network support, MemPush protects user anonymity when sending transactions.

## Technical features

The GitHub repository (https://github.com/valerio-vaccaro/mempush) shows an elegant Python implementation, based on the Flask framework and integrated with a database for transaction management. MemPush relies on services like blockstream.info and mempool.space to monitor and propagate transactions, with future plans for integrating a local Bitcoin node.

Main strengths:
- **Security**: No sensitive data or private keys are stored, ensuring total protection.
- **Scalability**: Supports high transaction volume thanks to direct connection with the Bitcoin network.
- **Open-source**: Public code allows verification, contributions, and customizations by the community.

## Conclusion

MemPush is a powerful and accessible solution for anyone who wants to send and manage Bitcoin transactions in the mempool without complications. With its transparency, privacy support, and ease of use, it represents a valuable addition to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
