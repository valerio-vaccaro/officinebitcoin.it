# Officine Bitcoin

## What is Officine Bitcoin?
A series of online, free, and regularly scheduled events on topics related to Bitcoin or similar to it.

The events are organized to occupy a maximum of 30 minutes, of which a first part is intended for the lesson (for example, initial 10 minutes) and the remaining part is intended for questions and support to participants.

Lessons will be held on Telegram in the [Officine Bitcoin](https://t.me/officinebitcoin) group.

Remember to NEVER share personal information/mnemonics and other secrets with the class or instructor.

## Languages
Given the interest in Officine Bitcoin lessons, lesson notes will also be translated into other languages; for now, the following translations are available:
- [Italiano](./index.html)
- [English](./index.en.html)
- [Milan√©s](./index.mi.html)

## Who holds the lessons?
Anyone who has the skills. Do you have a topic you want to talk about? Create your lesson.

## How can I contribute
- Have you followed the lessons and feel particularly ready on a topic? Great, you can follow a series of lessons on the same topic to transfer knowledge to other people,
- You can also suggest new topics and themes, perhaps finding a suitable instructor to maintain the lessons
- Obviously, you can also help us make the Officine Bitcoin project known

## Recordings
Lessons and debate are deliberately NOT recorded, but it doesn't matter much; if you miss a meeting, you can always wait for the next one to learn or ask your questions.

## Offtopics
Everything that is not related to the lesson (even if interesting) is offtopic and can only be addressed by creating an ad-hoc event.

It remains forbidden to create lessons on:
- shitcoin/altcoin/token etc,
- politics/parties/elections (obviously monetary policy is not forbidden),
- sports/sports teams/sports competitions,
- sex.

## Fundraising/payments/offerings
Fundraising and contributions and payment of offerings to follow lessons are prohibited activities; we keep Officine Bitcoin open to everyone and free.
